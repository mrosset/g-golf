* Severity levels

** 7 critical

makes unrelated software on the system (or the whole system) break, or
causes serious data loss, or introduces a security hole on systems
where you install the package.

** 6 grave

makes the package in question unusable or mostly so, or causes data
loss, or introduces a security hole allowing access to the accounts of
users who use the package.

** 5 serious

is a severe violation of Debian policy (roughly, it violates a "must"
or "required" directive), or, in the package maintainer's or release
manager's opinion, makes the package unsuitable for release.

** 4 important

a bug which has a major effect on the usability of a package, without
rendering it completely unusable to everyone.

** 3 normal

the default value, applicable to most bugs.

** 2 minor

a problem which doesn't affect the package's usefulness, and is
presumably trivial to fix.

** 1 wishlist

for any feature request, and also for any bugs that are very difficult
to fix due to major design considerations.
