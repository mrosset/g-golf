makeinfo convert @deffn and similar functions to something inside
<blockquote>.  style.css uses italic for blockquote.  This looks poor
in the Emacs manuals, which make extensive use of @defun (etc).  In
particular, references to function arguments appear as <var> inside
<blockquote>.  Since <var> is also italic, it makes it impossible to
distinguish variables.  We could change <var> to e.g. bold-italic, or
normal, or a different color, but that does not look as good IMO.  So
we just override blockquote to be non-italic.
