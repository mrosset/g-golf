The following is not working yet, it segfault, complaining that:

  /opt2/bin/guile: symbol lookup error: /opt2/lib/libg-golf.so:
  undefined symbol: g_type_name

  [ which is weird since g_type_name is defined in GObject Tye nfo, and
  [ so it should be part of glib-object.h, afaict at least.

It is not a real problem though, because we already bind g_type_name
using the ffi, in (g-golf gobject type-info).  I'll try to fix this
later.

(define g_object_type_name
  (pointer->procedure '*
                      (dynamic-func "g_object_type_name"
                                    %libg-golf)
                      (list '*)))
